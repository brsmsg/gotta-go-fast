gotta-go-fast has three modes of operation. In all three modes, type through the presented text and then submit with ENTER. You MUST correct your mistakes before you can submit. Press ESC at any time to restart.

1. NONSENSE MODE Run with no file inputs, it will generate nonsense which is statistically similar to English text. Words appear in the nonsense with the same frequency that they appear in actual English. The length of the nonsense can be specified with --nonsense-len (-l) (in characters).

    $ gotta-go-fast

2. CHUNK MODE Run with files to sample from, it will sample a random chunk from a random file as input. This works well for code or other text without a clear paragraph structure. Specify the height of the chunk in lines with --height (-h).

    $ gotta-go-fast src/*

3. PARAGRAPH MODE Run with files to sample from, and --paragraph (-p), it will sample a random paragraph (empty line delimited) from a random file. This works well for prose such as Project Gutenberg books. Reflow text to the target width with --reflow (-r). Specify the maximum and minimum length for a paragraph with --max-paragraph-len and --min-paragraph-len (in characters).

    $ gotta-go-fast -p books/*.txt

In all three modes the width of the text can be set with --width (-w), the tab width can be set with --tab (-t) and the colour of empty (not yet typed) text and of errors can be set with --fg-empty and --fg-error (ANSI colour codes).
